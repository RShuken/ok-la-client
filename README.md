## Description

This is a full stack project that showcases my ability to create custom data structures using linked list, React, Express and Node to create a language learning community platform.

Users can add community language flashcard decks, create their own and share.

# Demo Account

Login with this user and password to test the app.

`Username: demo`
`Password: 1234Qwer!`

Create your own account and a default deck of `french` will be created for you. Add more decks in the community hub. On your dashboard page, create a new deck. You must add a `minimum of 3` cards to start learning with a deck. Make the deck public by clicking the checkbox to share it to the community.
